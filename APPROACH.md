## Session 001
### 240 mins
Done
- Made a tiny, messy, not-fun-to-play mvp

V1:
![001](WIP/001.gif)
I didn't really like this movement, and the format won't really fit the art that I'm envisioning.

V2:
![002](WIP/002.gif)
A top down view with a free-roaming player will work much better I think, and a joystick suits that better than buttons. The world will be as if looking through a microscope, so I think a bit of float on the character controller will be good.

V3:
![003](WIP/003.gif)
Added hazards

V4:
![004](WIP/004.gif)
Added collectibles and a timer

V5:
![005](WIP/005.gif)
Added the core mechanic besides movement: transfer of energy. Touching and holding a hazard will move 'mana' from the player to the hazard, until it becomes friendly. If the player runs out of mana, it dies.

V6:
![006](WIP/006.gif)
Added moving hazards with various mana needs and drops. Converting hazards to friendlies will make more mana available to the player, and allow progress through the levels.
